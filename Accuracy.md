#### Write information only that you  understand, and then verify it

- Make sure procedures are correct after proper understanding of the subject and they work when a user follows  them. 

- Write the information and have it reviewed as many  times as necessary to ensure that it is accurate by the time when you  publish the information.

- Increase your knowledge of how your users do their jobs so that you can develop accurate information that would make their jobs easier.




#### Keep up with technical changes 

- Each time that you publish a new edition of your information, ensure that  trademarks, product names and release levels, and boilerplate information are currents.

- Accuracy problems can result when you include graphics that show all or  part of the user interface if the interface changes after the information is  finalized. Therefore make sure interface descriptions  are consistent with the actual interface.   

- Keep updates of web information at an acceptable frequency.   

- Include  only information that is current, avoid including information that is likely to  become quickly outdated, and validate the currency of existing information.




#### Maintain consistency of all information about a subject  

- Single source refers to the use of the same source, with few or no changes, for different outputs. Use help of single source to develop a topic and use it in multiple context.  

- Use conditional text. Conditional text provide increased flexibility in reusing the information for multiple contexts.

- Make sure duplicated information is consistent. A good general rule for making information consistent is to minimize the number of places where you include the same information.

- Another good practice is to insert comments into the source for your topics  (if your authoring tool allows) or into a separate history file for your project. These comments can identify interdependencies within information that you  write, or between your information and the information that your colleagues write.

- Use topic titles such that it should accurately reflect the content of the topic.

  

#### Use tools that automate checking for  accuracy 

-  Use a grammar-checking tool for typographical and grammatical errors. Make sure syntax descriptions, procedures, and other types of information  are free of spelling errors. 



#### Check the accuracy of references to  related information 

- For online information, make sure that each link  goes to the correct information. For printed information, make sure that  internal cross-references point to the correct information.   

- Whenever you update your information, verify all existing references..  

- Make sure titles and order numbers in references are accurate.
